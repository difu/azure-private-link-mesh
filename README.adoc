A reference implementation of a secure, scalable Hub-and-Spoke network topology in Azure using Terraform. This setup demonstrates private service access via Private Endpoints and centralized DNS resolution via Azure Private DNS Zones.

== 🧠 Overview

`azure-private-link-mesh` provisions the following resources:

- A **Hub VNet** hosting a centralized Private DNS Zone
- One or more **Spoke VNets**
- A **Storage Account** with a **Private Endpoint** in a Spoke
- **Private DNS Zone** linked to the Hub and Spokes
- **VNet Peering** between Hub and Spokes

This architecture allows spoke resources to resolve Azure service FQDNs via Private DNS, ensuring fully private communication.

== 🛡️ Security

- All data access is via **Private IPs**.
- No public IPs are exposed for services.
- DNS resolution is internal and isolated per network.
